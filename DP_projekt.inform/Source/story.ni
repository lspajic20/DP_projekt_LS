"Escape into reality" by Lucija

when play begins:
say "[italic type]You are sleeping and everything around you is very similar to the real world. You pass through some rooms and landscapes and you really want to wake up. There is an obstacle on the way to awakening... In order to wake up, you must reach the Room of memories and unlock the Door of truth. But it's not that simple... Pay attention to the things around you and when a special message appears, keep in mind that you can then wake up from your dream and return to reality, but the only way is to unlock the door of truth. "
